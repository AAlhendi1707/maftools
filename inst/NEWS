CHANGES IN VERSION 1.8.10
-------------------------
SIGNIFICANT USER-LEVEL IMPROVEMENT
    o Oncoplot, oncostrip and coOncoplot code has been migrated from ComplexHeatmap to base graphics. Default values for some arguments have been changed.
    o Changed default value for mafObj argument in subsetMaf to TRUE. #235
    o All ggplots are migrated to base graphics for consistancy
    o TCGA mutations per sample used for tcgaCompare are updated to more stable MC3 cohort from deprecated broad firehose.

    o tcgaCompare now accpets comparing against user specifc cohorts. Issue: #229
    o Add missing genes and samples to oncoplot even when they are not altered. Issue: #254
    o Added MTRNR2L8 protein structure to pfam database. Issue: #255
    o Added addtionalFeature argument to oncoplots. Issue: #270
    o Added log scale option for summary and oncoplots. Issue: #273

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.8.0
-------------------------
NEW FUNCTIONS
    o OncogenicPathways - Perform enrichment for known oncogenic pathways from TCGA studies.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.50
-------------------------
NEW FUNCTIONS
    o plotApobecDiff - plots differences between APOBEC enriched and non APOBEC enriched samples
    o gisticOncoplot, gisticBubblePlot and gisticChromPlot to visualize GISTIC results

SIGNIFICANT USER-LEVEL IMPROVEMENT
    o Changes to MAF object. It now includes clinical data similar to PhenoData of expressionset objects.
    o Oncomatrix is built on the fly whenever required, its no longer stored in MAF object.
    o Many sorting options to oncplots.
    o rainfallPlot can detect hyper mutated genomic segments via ChangePoint detection method
    o plotSignatures includes cosine similarity score and aetiology of detected signature
    o readGistic has argument cnLevel to choose deep or shallow CN variants
    o inferHeterogeneity includes MATH score in the plot
    o One can include q values from mutsig (or any similar program) as a side barplot in oncoplot
    o Tumor_Sample_Barcodes remains as is; earlier '-' were converted to '.' in sample names
    o New function mutCountMatrix to generate count matrix

NON SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
    o mafCompare output includes adjusted p-values
    o trinucleotideMatrix output includes adjusted p-values for APOBEC enrichment
    o added plot arguments to control title size and point size in lollipopPlot

BUG FIXES
    o Major bug fix in signature analysis
    o minor bug fixes in plotGisticResults and oncostrip
